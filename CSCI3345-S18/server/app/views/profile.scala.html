<p id="intro">Hello, my name is Sarah, this is my first attempt oops, um, at a Meowder account. Um, this is my first time at online dating, so I’m nervous but I’m<br> excited at the same time. So I’m just gonna start talking about what I like, and hope I get some replies. So I am a recent umm, MBA grad from Villanova. I love cats. Um, I just. Sorry, I’m getting emotional. I love cats. I love every kind of cat. Sorry. I just. I really love cats and I just wanna<br> hug all of them but I can’t cause it’s crazy. I can’t hug every cat. But I just want to. I want to. I want to. Umm. I’m sorry. I just I get. Anytime I hear<br> cat, I jus- I love cats.</p>
<p id="cattalk">Ah, whooo! I promised myself I wouldn’t cry. So anyway I am a cat lover. And I love to run. I’m sorry I’m thinking about cats again. I just – I think about how many don’t have a home and how I should have them and how cute they are and how their ears and the whiskers and the nose, I just love them and I want them and I want them basket. And I want little bow ties. I want them to be on a rainbow and just in my bed, and I just want a house full of them and I just want us to roll around – I can’t I can’t.</p>
